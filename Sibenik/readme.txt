Usage
=====

On the commandline, use this syntax:

ParticleTrimmer <imagefile> <threshold 0-255> <vertex_count 3-8> [options]

	Option | Type   | Default | Description
	-------+--------+---------+------------------------------------------------------------
	 -ax   | int    |    1    | Atlas tile count in x
	 -ay   | int    |    1    | Atlas tile count in y
	 -sx   | float  |   1.0   | Scale factor of final x-coordinates
	 -sy   | float  |   1.0   | Scale factor of final y-coordinates
	 -bx   | float  |   0.0   | Bias factor of final x-coordinate
	 -by   | float  |   0.0   | Bias factor of final y-coordinate
	 -h    | int    |   50    | Maximum convex hull size to reduce to before optimization
	 -sp   | int    |   16    | Sub-pixel division when generating the convex hull
	 -d    | int    |    0    | Number of times to initially dilate the image
	 -i    | int[n] |  NULL   | Index buffer. Used to optimize vertex ordering if provided.
